# What need be done:

- [ ] May be `nodemon` js-package will be installed for faster debug.
- [x] Make uploading file limit.
- [ ] Connect and configure a relational database. In progress now.
- [ ] Implement authorization, as well as lay the foundation for storing logins and passwords, and possibly enable data storage in cookies.
- [ ] Consider and implement storage of user authorization data in a secure (encrypted?) form.
- [ ] Integrate a neural network to generate the final product.
- [x] Conduct full unit testing (optional) (The decision was made to abandon it, taking into account the sustainability of the project's tools.).
